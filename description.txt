----The Verdant Mod----
by GabeHasWon

This mod adds the Verdant, a fairly small, underground biome that spawns naturally, containing many types of plants and critters.
It has the following basic content:
    - 92 new items
    - 70 new tiles
    - 12 new walls
    - 9 new NPCs
    - 3 brand new music tracks
    - A new foreground and background system that gives more life to the biome

--Development--

I wanted to make this mod with the understanding that open source content is very important to modding, and so, this mod is open-source and under the GPLv3 liscense.
As such, anyone can use any code or asset from this mod freely in their own projects - all I ask is a credit in your mod's description or Github repository.
Once I get the Discord properly set up, you will be able to ask development related questions in the appropriate channel as well - stay tuned.
