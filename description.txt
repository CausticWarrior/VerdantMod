----The Verdant Mod----
by GabeHasWon

A mod dedicated to cultivating the Verdant - a lush underground cave system with plants and trees (and critters!) about.

As of writing this, the mod has the following:
	- 85 new items
	- 70 new tiles
	- 12 new walls
	- 9 new NPCs
	- 3 brand new music tracks
	- A new foreground and background system that gives more life to the biome
...and more!

--Development--

I wanted to make this mod with the understanding that open source content is very important to modding, and so, this mod is open-source and under the GPLv3 liscense.
As such, anyone can use any code or asset from this mod freely in their own projects - all I ask is a credit in your mod's description or Github repository.
Once I get the Discord properly set up, you will be able to ask development related questions in the appropriate channel as well - stay tuned.
