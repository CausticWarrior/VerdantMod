by GabeHasWon

This mod adds the Verdant, a fairly small, underground biome that spawns naturally, containing many types of plants and critters.
It has the following basic content:
    - 98 new items
    - 76 new tiles
    - 12 new walls
    - 9 new NPCs
    - 4 brand new music tracks
    - A new foreground and background system that gives more life to the biome
    - A sort of quest system by the statue in the center of the biome, the Apotheosis

----Frequently Asked Questions----
Q: Does this mod work with Calamity?
