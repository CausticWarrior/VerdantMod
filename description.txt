--Development--

I wanted to make this mod with the understanding that open source content is very important to modding, and so, this mod is open-source and under the GPLv3 liscense.
As such, anyone can use any code or asset from this mod freely in their own projects - all I ask is a credit in your mod's description or Github repository.
Once I get the Discord properly set up, you will be able to ask development related questions in the appropriate channel as well - stay tuned.
